# Air Quality Time Series Analysis – Dar es Salaam

This repository contains a time series analysis of air quality in Dar es Salaam, focusing on PM2.5 levels. The project utilizes autoregressive modeling to make predictions and analyze trends over time.

## Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Explore historical air quality data for Dar es Salaam.
- Build and evaluate forecasting models for PM2.5 levels.
- Visualize trends and predictions using interactive plots.

## Dataset

The dataset includes air quality measurements over time, specifically PM2.5 concentrations. Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, scaling, and splitting into training and testing sets.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying trends and seasonality.
3. **Modeling** – Using Autoregressive (AR) models for forecasting.
4. **Evaluation** – Assessing model performance using MAE and other metrics.
5. **Visualization** – Generating time series plots and prediction graphs.

## Key Dependencies

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `statsmodels`
- `plotly`

## Results

The final model provides insights into PM2.5 fluctuations and can be used for future air quality forecasting.
